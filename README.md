# PCSP

A small Java library of concepts in the theory of Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Universal Algebra which I used during my thesis preparation and preceding research in order to automate some computations.

It is in no way a general self-contained since it is only usable in the context of my research.

The corresponding packages contain the classes and interfaces representing the following concepts:
- Function sets
- Generative minions (PCSP theory); in particular: *XOR, THR, AT, ST*
- Polymorphic operators; in particular: *min, max, majority, minority*
- Boolean functions (plain/idempotent/folded)
- Misc utility code
